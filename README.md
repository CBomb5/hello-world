  My name is Zheng Qi Christine Case.  I am an engineer, though not professional quite yet.  I love to hang out with my friends and family, playing games, watching movies, and growing up.  I love to lead, sing, and move.  I want to learn how to code in college so I won't have to learn it later.  I wish I had these opportunities in high school!  I am grateful I have them now because some people in this world never get them.  Praise God!
  I will not stop at whatever it takes to honor my Messiah, Jesus Christ.
  This is my biography and I am proud of the life I live, though I work to improve its purpose constantly.  Sometimes I wonder if I should study people, because I think about them in relation to cultures often.  But I feel called to be an engineer, therefore, I will pursue the engineering field to help people.
